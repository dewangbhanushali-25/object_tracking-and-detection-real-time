# YOLOv8 + DeepSORT Object Detection and Tracking
This repository implements a robust object detection and tracking system combining YOLOv8 for detection and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking.
Overview
The system uses a two-stage approach:

Object Detection: YOLOv8 identifies objects in individual frames
Object Tracking: DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) maintains object identities across frames

This combination creates a powerful solution for applications like surveillance, traffic monitoring, sports analytics, and more.
Features

Real-time object detection using state-of-the-art YOLOv8
Persistent object tracking across video frames with DeepSORT
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based appearance feature extraction
Support for multiple object classes
Configurable detection confidence thresholds
Performance optimizations for real-time processing
